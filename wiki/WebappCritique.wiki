Critique of group A's webapp:

The app had a nice, "pretty" login page, and overall design. If the categories in the left sidebar could be alphabeticized, that would make the design absolutely perfect. Most of the functions seemed to be working flawlessly, except for the conferenceMeetings page which threw a 'ReferenceProperty failed to be resolved' error when I signed in as a faculty member. Also, some sort of indication of what format the text boxes wanted their data in would be nice. It took me a few tries to figure out which format the date was to be entered. When signed in as an admin, I was able to add graduate students, with the same functionality being available to faculty members, which was a little redundant. The graduate students page, for faculty members, just listed the name of the students. There was no way of viewing their degree, thesis etc. Also, some of the pages (Degrees, Office hours) for the faculty members let them enter data in text boxes, which should have been pulled in from the database and presented as dropdown menus or something.
